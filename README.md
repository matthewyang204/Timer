# Timer v1.0 (Beta)
This code runs a timer in a terminal. It is available as a Unix Executable or a Python file. I recommend downloading and using the Unix Executable for Mac, Linux, and ChromeOS users. I recommend the Python file for Windows users. Also, this is beta software, and there are known bugs. Visit the "Issues" section to check on bugs.
